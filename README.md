## LangChain Udemy Course

Welcome to the AI Agents with LangChain and LangGraph Udemy course - Unleashing the Power of Agentic AI!
This  course is designed to teach you how to QUICKLY harness the power the LangChain & LangGraph libraries for LLM applications and Agentic AI.
This course will equip you with the skills and knowledge necessary to develop cutting-edge LLM solutions for a diverse range of topics.

| Please note that this is not a course for beginners. This course assumes that you have a background in software engineering and are proficient in Python. I will be using Pycharm IDE but you can use any editor you'd like since we only use basic feature of the IDE like debugging and running scripts .

*What You’ll Build:*  No fluff. No toy examples. You’ll build:

- Search Agent
- Documentation Helper – A chatbot over Python package docs (and any data you choose), using advanced retrieval and RAG.
- Slim ChatGPT Code Interpreter – A lightweight code execution assistant.
- Prompt Engineering Theory Section
- Introduction to LangGraph
- Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Ice Breaker Agent – An AI agent that searches Google, finds LinkedIn and Twitter profiles, scrapes public info, and generates personalized icebreakers.
